        <p id="p1">Rise, Tarnished, and be guided by grace to brandish the power of the Elden Ring and become an Elden Lord in the Lands Between.</p> 
        <p id="p2">In the Lands Between ruled by Queen Marika the Eternal, the Elden Ring, the source of the Erdtree, has been shattered.</p>
        <p id="p3">Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring known as the Great Runes, and the mad taint of their newfound strength triggered a war: 
            <br>The Shattering. A war that meant abandonment by the Greater Will.</p>
        <p id="p4">And now the guidance of grace will be brought to the Tarnished who were spurned by the grace of gold and exiled from the Lands Between.<br> Ye dead who yet live, your grace long lost, follow the path to the Lands Between beyond the foggy sea to stand before the Elden Ring.</p>
        <p id="p5">And become the Elden Lord.</p>
